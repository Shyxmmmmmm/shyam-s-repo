sum of n numbers means use ---> 
1,3,6,10,15------>  n(n+1)//2


sum of the series
1+(1+2)+(1+2+3) -------> n(n+1)(n+2)//6


sum of square of the series and sum of aodd number boh are same only:
1^2+2^2+3^2----> n*(n+1)*(2n+1)//6

sum of cube of series is:
(n(n+1)//2)^2


sum of fourth power:
n(n+1)(2n+1)(3n^2+3nâˆ’1)//30

sm of fifth power:
n^2*(n+1)^2*(2n^2+2n-1)//12
